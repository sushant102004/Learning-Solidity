## Lesson 2 - Deploying contracts via contracts

In this lesson I learnt how to deploy contracts using other contracts. 

A <b>StorageFacotry</b> contract is made that create an instance of Simple Storage contract and hence push it into an array.

I also created <b>sfStore</b> and <b>sfGet</b> functions to interact with <b>store</b> and <b>retrieve</b> functions available in SimpleStorage contract.

Used <b>virtual</b> and <b>override</b> keywords for inheritance.
